# DMPC_for_cooperation

This repository contains the code used in the simulation examples in 

M. Köhler, M. A. Müller, and F. Allgöwer, "Distributed MPC for Self-Organized Cooperation of Multi-Agent Systems,", 2023, available on arxiv. doi: 10.48550/arXiv.2210.10128

The code relies on CasADi (https://web.casadi.org/) which in turn uses Ipopt (https://coin-or.github.io/Ipopt/).
